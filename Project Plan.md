Nutirital Database Programs Objectives 
1. Name: Food Search
   Description: Enable users to search for foods by name and display all the nutritional information;
2. Name: Nutrition Breakdown
   Description: Enable users to select one food, and display pie charts & bar graphs showing the breakdown of different nutrients for the selected food.
3. Name: Nutrition Range Filter
   Description: Enable users to select one of nutrition and input minimum & maximum values, and the tool will display a list of foods that fall within those ranges.
4. Name: Nutrition Level Filter

These stakeholders collaborate to ensure the database is comprehensive, accurate, and useful for improving nutrition outcomes.

### 1.3 Project Scope

A Nutrition Database is a comprehensive collection of data on the nutritional content of various foods. It typically includes information on macronutrients (like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats), micronutrients (such as vitamins and minerals), and other components like fiber and water content. 

### What is Included:
1. **Food Items**: A wide range of foods, including raw ingredients, processed foods, and restaurant meals.
2. **Nutrient Information**: Detailed data on macronutrients, micronutrients, and other dietary components.
3. **Serving Sizes**: Standardized serving sizes to ensure consistency.
4. **Food Categories**: Classification of foods into categories like fruits, vegetables, grains, etc.
5. **Source Information**: Details about the source of the data, such as laboratory analysis or manufacturer-provided information.

### Managing What is Included:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from reliable sources, including scientific research, food manufacturers, and government databases.
2. **Data Verification**: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data through rigorous validation processes.
3. **Regular Updates**: Continuously updating the database to reflect new research, changes in food formulations, and new food products.
4. **User Feedback**: Incorporating feedback from users to improve the database's accuracy and usability.

### Excluding Data:
1. **Inaccurate Data**: Excluding data that cannot be verified or is found to be inaccurate.
2. **Outdated Information**: Removing outdated information that no longer reflects current food compositions.
3. **Non-Nutritional Data**: Excluding data that is not relevant to nutritional content, such as marketing claims or non-nutritional additives.


## 2. Work Breakdown Structure

## 4. Gantt Chart
You have to use the provided Gantt chart template.  

Use the provided Gantt chart template to list all items from the Activity Definition along with relevant estimates 
and scheduling. Ensure that the Gantt chart reflects the activity definitions from Section 3. Track actual start 
times and durations. Besides including Gantt chart here, you should also submit your Gantt chart file separately.
