### Project Overview

The Nutritional Food Database Analysis and Visualization Tool is a desktop application designed to empower users with comprehensive nutritional information and analysis capabilities. This software aims to address the challenge of making informed dietary choices by providing an intuitive interface for exploring and understanding nutritional data.

Key features include:
1. Food search functionality with detailed nutritional information display
2. Interactive visualization of nutrition breakdowns using pie charts and bar graphs
3. Advanced filtering options based on nutritional content ranges and levels
4. Side-by-side comparison of multiple food items
5. Personalized meal planning based on user-defined nutritional goals and preferences

The application utilizes the Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database, offering detailed nutritional information for a wide range of food items. It's designed to cater to health-conscious individuals, dieters, nutritionists, and dietitians, providing a powerful tool for dietary analysis and decision-making.

Our team is developing this tool as part of a group project, focusing on creating a user-friendly, efficient, and informative application that can significantly impact users' understanding of their dietary choices.

# 1. Introduction

The group project consists of two milestones:

- **Milestone 1**: Project Management
- **Milestone 2**: Data Analysis and Visualisation

The primary goal of Milestone 2 in the group project is to use **wxPython** and **wxFormBuilder** to develop a desktop application, specifically a simple data analysis and visualisation tool for the provided database. Your team designed this software in Milestone 1, and now, in Milestone 2, you will begin implementing it. Ensure that the software is not only functional but also user-friendly and thoroughly tested to enhance its overall quality and reliability.

All work must be hosted on the same GitHub repository created in Milestone 1 with access restricted to your group members. Download **Milestone_2.zip**, unzip it, and upload the contents to your group GitHub repository. Your team has to use the same guide **Group_Project_Collaboration_Workflow.pdf**.

Download **Group_Project_Collaboration_Workflow.pdf** provided in Milestone 1 to collaborate on the group project and synchronize the code.

This repository will have a track record of regular commits, showcasing the incremental and collaborative efforts on the project. All project resources (python code, documents, images, and others) should be stored in the GitHub repository.
