## Nutritional Food Database Analysis and Visualization Tool

### Project Overview

The Nutritional Food Database Analysis and Visualization Tool is a desktop application designed to empower users with comprehensive nutritional information and analysis capabilities. This software aims to address the challenge of making informed dietary choices by providing an intuitive interface for exploring and understanding nutritional data.

Key features include:
1. Food search functionality with detailed nutritional information display
2. Interactive visualization of nutrition breakdowns using pie charts and bar graphs
3. Advanced filtering options based on nutritional content ranges and levels
4. Side-by-side comparison of multiple food items
5. Personalized meal planning based on user-defined nutritional goals and preferences

The application utilizes the Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database, offering detailed nutritional information for a wide range of food items. It's designed to cater to health-conscious individuals, dieters, nutritionists, and dietitians, providing a powerful tool for dietary analysis and decision-making.

Our team is developing this tool as part of a group project, focusing on creating a user-friendly, efficient, and informative application that can significantly impact users' understanding of their dietary choices.
